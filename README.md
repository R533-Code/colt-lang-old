## Colt:
A programming language in its early stages of development.

## Features:
For the eleventh time, a whole codebase rewrite is in progress.
Currently, only the lexer and parts of the AST are written and functional.
In this rewrite, the design of the compiler follows a more data-oriented
approach, as seen in [Chandler Carruth's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI198eFghJk).

## CI:
